# Customer Churn Prediction Web App

## ðŸ“Œ Overview
This is a **Flask-based web application** for predicting customer churn using a pre-trained machine learning model.  
Users can input customer details, and the app will predict whether the customer is **at high risk of leaving** or **likely to stay**.  
The model is powered by **scikit-learn** and uses a **RandomForest Classifier** (saved as `RandomClassifier.pkl`) along with a `StandardScaler` for data preprocessing.
